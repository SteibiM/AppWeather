# AppWeather

Hello,

This is a simple application that shows the weather and other details in this field, using API OpenWeather.I used knowledge related to java, json structure, android-studio through which I downloaded and processed data from the link depending on the city, the indicated village.The main code can be found on the following path: AppWeather/app/src/main/java/com/aplication/appweather/MainActivity.java/.


Good luck!
